# Fireproof S3 bucket adapter

This uses verified uploads, addressed by content hash identifier.

- User-agent pings a Lambda API with the intended hash identifier and size for the object they are about to upload.
- Lambda returns a signed URL from an AWS account private key. The URL authorizes the holder to upload only the object matching content identifer (thanks to platform level hash validation in S3/R2/Azure).
- The client PUTs to the URL and the content is written.
- Subsequent reads for that content identifier will return the content, nothing invalid can overwrite it.

Because the files Fireproof writes are encrypted by the browser, and the metadata is not stored in the bucket (but rather in your secure session storage) this bucket is safe for public reads.

# S3 presigned URLs with SAM, auth and sample frontend

This example application shows how to upload objects to S3 directly from your end-user application using Signed URLs.

To learn more about how this application works, see the AWS Compute Blog post: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/uploading-to-amazon-s3-directly-from-a-web-or-mobile-application/

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [AWS SAM CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) - minimum version 0.48.
* [NodeJS 16.x installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation Instructions

1. [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and login.

2. Clone the repo onto your local development machine using `git clone`.

### Installing the application

There are two SAM templates available - one provides an open API, the other uses an authorizer. From the command line, deploy the chosen SAM template:

```
cd .. 
sam deploy --guided
```

When prompted for parameters, enter:
- Stack Name: s3Uploader
- AWS Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
- Answer 'No' to `UploadRequestFunction may not have authorization defined, Is this okay?` question, and accept others defaults.

This takes several minutes to deploy. At the end of the deployment, note the output values, as you need these later.

- The APIendpoint value is important - it looks like https://ab123345677.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com.
- **The upload URL is your endpoint** with the /uploads route added - for example: https://ab123345677.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads.


### Testing with the frontend application

The frontend code is saved in the `frontend` subdirectory. 

1. Before running, you need to set the API Gateway endpoint from the backend deployment on line 29 in the `index.html` file.

2. You cannot run this directly on a local browser, due to way CORS works with localhost. Either [copy the file to an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/upload-objects.html), or [deploy using AWS Amplify Console](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/).

3. Once the page is loaded from a remote location, upload a JPG file in the front-end and you will see the object in the backend S3 bucket.

## Next steps

The AWS Compute Blog post at the top of this README file contains additional information about this pattern.
